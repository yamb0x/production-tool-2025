## Architecture Patterns

### State Management
- **React Context API**: Global state management
- **Multiple Contexts**: 
  - AuthContext (authentication)
  - ProjectContext (project data)
  - ArtistContext (artist data)
  - HistoryContext (booking history)
  - FinancialVisibilityContext (financial data display)

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/       # Reusable components
│   ├── Auth/        # Authentication components
│   ├── Database/    # Data table components
│   ├── Forms/       # Input forms
│   ├── Gantt/       # Gantt chart components
│   ├── History/     # History tracking
│   └── common/      # Shared UI components
├── contexts/        # React Context providers
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
├── pages/           # Route-level components
├── styles/          # Theme and global styles
└── utils/           # Helper functions
```

### Data Flow
1. **Firebase Realtime Database** stores all application data
2. **Context Providers** manage local state and sync with Firebase
3. **Components** consume data via hooks and contexts
4. **Real-time listeners** update UI when database changes

## Key Strengths

1. **Specialized for Creative Studios**: Tailored features for artist booking
2. **Visual Project Planning**: Intuitive Gantt chart interface
3. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work simultaneously
4. **Financial Transparency**: Clear budget and expense tracking
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all booking changes
6. **Responsive Design**: Works across devices
7. **Quick Tools Integration**: Built-in calculator and currency converter

## Areas for Enhancement

1. **Performance**: Large datasets may impact render performance
2. **Offline Support**: Limited functionality without internet
3. **Advanced Reporting**: Basic export capabilities
4. **Mobile Experience**: While responsive, could benefit from native app
5. **Scalability**: Firebase Realtime Database limitations for large teams
6. **Testing**: Limited test coverage visible in codebase
7. **TypeScript**: JavaScript codebase lacks type safety

## Security Considerations

- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Client-side validation (needs server-side enhancement)
- Financial visibility controls for sensitive data

## Data Model

### Projects
- id, name, startDate, endDate, budget
- additionalExpenses, bookings[], deliveries[]

### Artists
- id, name, email, website, country
- timezone, dailyRate, skills[], isFavorite

### Bookings
- id, artistId, artistName, startDate, endDate
- color, project reference

### History Entries
- timestamp, action, description, changes
- userId, bookingId, projectId

## Migration Considerations for v2.0

1. **Data Structure**: Current Firebase structure could map to PostgreSQL
2. **State Management**: Context API could migrate to more robust solution
3. **Component Library**: MUI components are well-structured for reuse
4. **Business Logic**: Mixed with UI, needs extraction for clean architecture
5. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth could transition to custom solution
6. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket implementation needed for PostgreSQL

## Conclusion

The MVP successfully demonstrates a functional project management system with strong visual planning capabilities and real-time collaboration features. The v1.5.0 release added crucial audit trail functionality. The codebase provides a solid foundation for understanding user needs and workflows, though significant architectural improvements would benefit a v2.0 implementation.
