## TDR-001: Modular Monolith Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  

### Context

With a 2-person team and rapid development timeline, we need an architecture that:
- Enables rapid development
- Minimizes operational complexity
- Allows future scaling without major rewrites
- Supports AI-assisted development

### Decision

We will build Production Tool 2.0 as a **modular monolith** with clear module boundaries and event-driven communication between modules.

### Rationale

1. **Development Speed**: Single codebase, unified deployment
2. **Operational Simplicity**: One application to monitor and deploy
3. **Future Flexibility**: Clear boundaries enable extraction to microservices
4. **AI Compatibility**: Monolithic structure easier for AI tools to understand

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|------------|------|------|
| Microservices | Better scaling, team independence | Complex for 2-person team, operational overhead |
| Serverless | Auto-scaling, pay-per-use | Cold starts, vendor lock-in, complex local dev |
| Traditional Monolith | Simplest approach | Hard to scale, no clear boundaries |

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Faster time to market
- Lower operational costs
- Easier debugging and testing
- Simpler deployment pipeline

**Negative**:
- Scaling requires more planning
- Risk of module coupling
- Single point of failure
- Database becomes bottleneck at scale

### Mitigation

- Enforce module boundaries via linting rules
- Use event bus for inter-module communication
- Design with future extraction in mind
- Database can be sharded by tenant

## TDR-002: PostgreSQL with Exclusion Constraints

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team  

### Context

The booking system requires absolute prevention of double-bookings. This is a critical business requirement that must be enforced at the database level.

### Decision

Use **PostgreSQL 15** with exclusion constraints using GiST indexes for booking conflict prevention.

```sql
EXCLUDE USING GIST (
    resource_id WITH =,
    tstzrange(start_time, end_time) WITH &&
) WHERE (status != 'cancelled')
```

### Rationale

1. **Data Integrity**: Database-level guarantee against conflicts
2. **Performance**: GiST indexes optimized for range queries
3. **Simplicity**: No need for complex application logic
4. **ACID Compliance**: Full transactional support

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|------------|------|------|
| Application-level checks | More flexible logic | Race conditions possible |
| Redis locks | Fast, distributed | Not persistent, complexity |
| MongoDB | Flexible schema | No exclusion constraints |
| DynamoDB | Serverless, scalable | Complex conflict detection |

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Guaranteed data integrity
- Excellent query performance
- Rich feature set (JSON, full-text search)
- Mature ecosystem

**Negative**:
- Vertical scaling limitations
- Requires database expertise
- More expensive than NoSQL at scale

### Mitigation

- Use read replicas for scaling reads
- Implement connection pooling
- Consider Neon for serverless PostgreSQL
- Plan for sharding by tenant
