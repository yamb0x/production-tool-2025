## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Database Conflict Prevention
**Risk**: GIST constraints might not prevent all conflict scenarios
**Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive testing of edge cases
- Application-level validation as backup
- Monitoring for constraint violations
- Rollback procedures for data issues

#### 2. Real-time Synchronization
**Risk**: WebSocket connections failing or causing inconsistent state
**Mitigation**:
- Automatic reconnection logic
- State reconciliation on reconnect
- Fallback to polling for critical updates
- Conflict resolution strategies

#### 3. Multi-tenant Data Isolation
**Risk**: Tenant data leak due to security vulnerabilities
**Mitigation**:
- Row-Level Security testing at database level
- Security audit of all API endpoints
- Automated testing for tenant isolation
- Regular penetration testing

### Contingency Plans

#### Development Delays
- **Scenario**: Features take longer than estimated
- **Response**: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-have features
- **Buffer**: Built-in 2-week buffer in timeline

#### Technical Blockers
- **Scenario**: Unforeseen technical challenges
- **Response**: Leverage AI assistance and community support
- **Escalation**: Consider alternative technical approaches

#### Team Availability
- **Scenario**: Team member unavailable
- **Response**: Comprehensive documentation and knowledge sharing
- **Cross-training**: Both developers familiar with all parts of system
